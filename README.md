### My process

I started off with the html structure first. Then went on to see the figma design available for the css part to be able to
reproduce the design as closely as possible. For the final part i tested the designs for responsiveness in the various
majorly available devices. The css seamlessly integrates with the various media sizes and hence media queries were not required.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Figma designs available

### What I learned

- Using custom fonts using @font-face property
- Using figma to observe the styling part
